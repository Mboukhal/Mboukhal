Full-stack developer with a passion for NextJs and TypeScript, I have been working on various projects that challenge me to solve structural and technical issues. My most recent role was at ThinkValue, where I volunteered as a backend developer, using SvelteKit to create innovative solutions. I also have experience in front-end development, having worked on the LIMS Development project at UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Digital Architecture at 1337 Future Is Loading. My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create impactful and user-friendly web applications.
